# React Reorderable

__Drag & drop, touch enabled, reorderable / sortable list, React component__

## About

React Reorderable is a React component that allows the user to drag-and-drop items in a list (horizontal / vertical) or a grid.

It fully supports touch devices and auto-scrolls when a component is being dragged (check out the demo, link below).

It also allows the user to set a hold time (duration before drag begins) allowing additional events like scrolling and clicking to be applied.

Although this project is very new, it has been thoroughly tested in all modern browsers (see supported browsers).
